# Edsger-Dijkstra

Author: Dionne Lewis Lomugdang- Edsger Dijkstra

  1) Dijkstra created an algorithm to find the shortest paths on nodes in graphs
  2) Developed the first compiler Algo-60, which is a high level programming language at the Mathematical Center.
  3) Contributed to the development of "predicate transformers" as a basis for defining program semantics and as a tool for deriving programs.
